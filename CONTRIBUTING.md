### Files

<p align='justify'>In this project we are using two programming languages: Python and Java. 
<i>Python</i> is used for the implementation of the compiler because of its ease and the PLY library that helps a lot of the work. 
<i>Java</i> is used with <i>Processing</i> for the development of the games and their connection to the Kinect. 
We ask you to follow this and <b>not put files in other programming languages</b>.</p>

  </div>
</div>  

### Variables and Functions

<p align='justify'>For the names of variables and functions please use <code>underscore_case</code>, the underscore 
version <b>much easier to read</b>.
Python also takes this notation as its standard, and we adopt it the same for java programming.
Take into account that the <b>variables and functions should always start with a lowercase letter</b>.
And very important to use <b>meaningful names</b>.</p>

> **Note:** For classes in Java, keep the given convention.

### Comments

<p align='justify'>For comments we ask you to make a header in each file that follows the <i>template</i> we provide, 
this is to have a brief description of the file in addition to knowing the author. As for the comments of each function, we hope that they are the most possible, neither too simple nor too elaborate.</p>

```
Header Template:
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# File: File.py|File.java
# Developed by: Names
# Project: FunSkills- [Compiler|Game]
# version: 0.0
# last edited by: Name:: hh.mm
#
# Description: A brief description of the code
#
# TEC 2019 | CE3104 - Lenguajes, Compiladores e Interpretes
# ------------------------------------------------------------
```
### Other important things

<p align='justify'>In addition to the aforementioned, it is good that you consider the following aspects:</p>

* Make the modular code, don't make 'god files'
* Do functions of considerable size. We don't want 1000 lines in a function!
* If you consider it necessary, you can add to our documentation folder the papers and material necessary to give the greatest clarity to your code.
